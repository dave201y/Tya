          <p><strong>TYA</strong> stands for excellence, grit, and transformation. Born out of a relentless drive to build something bigger, our brand is built not just on polishing cars — but on transforming how people feel about their vehicles.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Gorilla logo</strong> represents our mindset: strong, consistent, focused, and unshakable. We believe detailing is more than just cleaning — it’s restoration, renewal, and pride in ownership.</p>

          <p>Every vehicle we touch is treated like it’s our own. Whether you're a first-time customer or a lifelong client, we bring the same energy to every detail: premium quality, personalized care, and results that speak for themselves.</p>
